# Yet unnamed game
Simple platform game, still in early development, where the player moves 2 or more characters in a grid system, simultaneously, and must take all of them to it's correspondent objective tile.
Each movement can be both constructive or destructive torwards the objetive of different characters, so the player must think strategically and make use of insurmountable tiles (walls or obstacles) to reach a state in which all the characters are at their objective tiles.

## Implementation
The game is being written in Python, using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) library for the GUI.

## Running
To run the game, it is first necessary to install [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about).
That can be done with pip:

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

Then, running the demo.py file shows a brief preview of the game.
